# Statistics Study
Modelling signal and the backrounds simultaneously using different functions such as Gaussian, Crystall ball, double side crystall ball, Bernestein Polynomials, etc. 

For the fitting and limit calcuation, mostly taking help from Benjamin's code documented here, https://gitlab.cern.ch/hhtobbgg_nu/flashggFinalFit . It's still in progress and as mentioned by him this code mostly works for the Non-resonant case while we need to figure out for our resonant case. 




## References:
Fitting diphoton mass($m_{\gamma\gamma})$ and dibjet mass($m_{jj}$) following the same fitting instruction as we have from the Lata's analysis note, hi Shin-Shan, in section 5.4.1 of the analysis. Lata mentioned about the correlation, https://cms.cern.ch/iCMS/analysisadmin/cadilines?line=HIG-21-011.
