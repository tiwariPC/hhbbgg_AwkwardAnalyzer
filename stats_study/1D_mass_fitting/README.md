# 1D mass fitting 
Fitting of the signal and background with different functions and on the fitted function we are trying to preare a datacard. Further, on the datacard we run combine tool to get the limit.

Combine is asking of data observed or the toy data(asimov) for the limit extraction. 
-> We can provide data for specific mass either diphoton mass($m_\gamma\gamma$) or dibjet mass.
